IMPORTANT: All results are subject to variability when code is run due to randomization of CNNs.

OVERVIEW
This project uses three computer vision datasets for training and testing:

1. **RoboFlow Face Dataset**  
   - Total images: 2,468  
   - Categories: "drunk" and "sober" face images

2. **Kaggle Eye Direction Dataset**  
   - Total images: 14,500  
   - Categories: "forward", "left", "right", "closed"

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. All Jupyter notebooks provided in this repository include key performance metrics such as accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrices.
2. To reproduce the results:
   - Open each `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**
   - Make sure to **enable GPU** runtime (T4 GPU was used during development for performance)
     - *Runtime > Change runtime type > Select "GPU"*
3. Upload any necessary datasets if not already pre-loaded. Follow dataset path specifications in each notebook if needed.

NOTES

- Training results may slightly differ due to randomized weight initialization and data shuffling.
- For best results, ensure consistent hardware (GPU) and seed settings where applicable.
