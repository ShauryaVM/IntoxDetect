# IntoxDetect
Analysis of Deep-Learning CNNs and Large Language Models for Detection of Intoxication through Ocular and Facial Features

Every day, nearly 37 people in the United States die in drunk-driving crashesâ€”one person every 39 minutes. Despite significant progress in reducing drunk driving over the past decades, recent years have seen a troubling rise in alcohol-related accidents. Present methods of assessing intoxication are expensive, time-consuming, and often require specialized equipment and trained personnel(Sevincer2014). Traditional breathalyzers, blood tests, and field sobriety tests, while effective, are not always practical for widespread and routine use. As a result, non-invasive methods to detect intoxication so that drinkers can be warned proactively, are desirable. We propose a novel method of detecting intoxication through facial image analysis that can be used to combat drunk driving. We benchmarked the performance of GPT-4o as a classifier compared to CNN architectures on the face and eye image data. We found that the VGG16 and the Inception-ResNet-V2 models, trained & fine-tuned on 10000 facial images, had high accuracies of 83% and 82%, respectively, in detecting inebriation on the test sets. Considering there are no other variables besides the images, the model has immense potential as an AI facial intoxication detection system.
