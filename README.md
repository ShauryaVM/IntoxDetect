# IntoxDetect
Analysis of Deep-Learning CNNs and Large Language Models for Detection of Intoxication through Ocular and Facial Features

Every day, nearly 37 people in the United States die in drunk-driving crashesâ€”one person every 39 minutes. Despite significant progress in reducing drunk driving over the past decades, recent years have seen a troubling rise in alcohol-related accidents. Present methods of assessing intoxication are expensive, time-consuming, and often require specialized equipment and trained personnel. Traditional breathalyzers, blood tests, and field sobriety tests, while effective, are not always practical for widespread and routine use. As a result, non-invasive methods to detect intoxication so that drinkers can be warned proactively, are desirable. The present study proposes a novel method of detecting intoxication through image analysis that can be used to combat drunk driving.  We ran 2 pre-trained CNN models for image classification(VGG-16, Inception-ResNet-V2) in comparison to GPT-4o on the face and eye image data. We found that the VGG16 and the Inception-ResNet-V2 models, trained on facial images, had high accuracies of 82% and 80%, respectively, in detecting inebriation.  This figure is high, considering there are no other variables considered besides the images, showing the potential for an AI intoxication detection system utilizing not only image data but also other variables such as the time of day and temperature.
